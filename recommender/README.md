# EMBEDDINGS

This folder contains main scripts for the **embedding** generation. The main library used is *PyKEEN*, which is has a wide range of embeddin models already implemented. The script *PyKeen101.ipyb* contains the basic reference for the usage of the library.

Additionally, the library *torchKGE* has also been used to implement the fine tuning of TransE embeddings, as it has to be done ad-hoc. This will be used in the UI to generate the recommendations.
