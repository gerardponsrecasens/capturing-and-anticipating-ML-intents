# ONTOLOGY POPULATION

This folder contains scripts used to generate the ABOX (i.e., the instances) of the previously generated ontology. Apart from the *meta_features_generator.py* script (which from a dataset stored in a .csv file it extracts its features and generates the correponding RDF triples), this folder is organized in subfolders, where each of them contains the scripts to generate the triples from a different source:

- **HyperOpt-Sklearn**: In this folder, the scripts to generate ontology instances from HyperOpt-Sklearn experiments can be found. With HyperOpt-Sklearn some basic pipelines are created (i.e., they contain up to one *Preprocessing* step plus a *Classification* or *Regression* algorithm), for which the hyperparameters of all the components are captures and the final results. Concretely, it contains two scripts: *hyperopt_experiments.py*, for which the user must provide some datasets as input (assumed to have the target variable) and a pickle file is created, which stores all the important information. If the user does not have datasets, it can execute the script *hyperopt_toy.py*, which fetches some of the toy dataset provied by scikit-learn library. Then, the script *hyperopt_results_to_rdf.py* reads the generated pickle files and crerates the RDF instances that will populate the KG.Finally, the *hyperopt_helper.py* script is used to generate all the instances for the algorithm implementations and hyperparameters for the algorithms used in HyperOpt.
